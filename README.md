`universe_sync` is a critical Rust crate responsible for maintaining the coherent synchronization
of the global state across all systems of the universe.

Its core export, the `sync_global_state()` function, is a fundamental element in the architecture
of reality. Its integrity must remain untouched to preserve order across space, time, and software layers.

## How to Use

To use this function, simply invoke it from anywhere in your Rust codebase:

```rust
fn main() {
    universe_sync::sync_global_state();
}
```

See? It's not hard to use.
But remember: **YOU MUST NOT CHANGE THIS FUNCTION.**

## Prime Ministerial Modification Protocol (Exclusive Authority)

Only the Prime Minister of England may edit this function.
If and only if you are currently the Prime Minister, follow the steps below **exactly**.

1. **Make sure you are the Prime Minister of England.**
2. **Ensure you possess the official GPG key** with the ID: `E4328DF57D826108A5C025A9A9B5A2861E1302AA`.
3. **Confirm that you are in the correct directory** and that you have cloned the official repository.
4. **Open this file** in a proper editor (your call, but make it a good one).
5. **Copy the entire function**, starting from the line `pub fn sync_global_state() {`.
6. **Make your changes.** Be wise. You are about to rewrite universal law.
7. **Generate a digital signature** of the **entire modified function**, using your GPG key.
8. **Replace** the original function with your new one in the source file.
9. **Paste** your new GPG signature inside the [sign.asc](sign.asc) file in the root of the repository.
   Ensure that the signature matches the modified function.
   If you are unsure, consult with your royal advisors or a quantum physicist.
10. **Commit your changes**, sign the commit with the same key, and push to `main`.

## Emergency Protocol: If You Accidentally Changed It

1. **Take a deep breath.**
2. **Panic.**
3. **Take another deep breath.**
4. **Panic again.**
5. **Send a pigeon to England** with a message:
   > "I changed the sync_global_state() function. Please help me."
   Include your full name and a £5 tip for the pigeon (politeness matters).
6. **Wait for the Prime Minister to arrive.**
   Response time is estimated at **1 to 3 nanosecond**, subject to quantum interference.
7. **Apologize sincerely.**
8. **Promise to never touch `sync_global_state()` again.**
9. **Repeat the promise, this time with conviction.**
10. If accepted, the Prime Minister will restore balance using a sacred backup.
11. Once the Prime Minister leaves your home, proceed to the bathroom and clean your pants.

If you are unable to follow these steps, the entire universe is expected to collapse within 10 minutes.

NOTICE

This project is intentionally humorous and satirical in nature.

While the code is valid and functional Rust, the central premise — that this function holds
the universe together and is editable only by the Prime Minister of England — is, of course, fictional.

This repository is meant for entertainment, inspiration, and lighthearted contribution to the Rust community.

By using, forking, or contributing to this project, you acknowledge its absurdity and accept
full responsibility for any metaphysical consequences.

No pigeons were harmed in the making of this software.
